Prime words:

Consider number representation in a 36-base system. We use 0 to 9 to 
represent the first 10 symbols and the alphabets A to Z to represent the 
next 26 symbols. Regular words in the english language will be numbers in 
this 36-base number system. 

The problem is to find out which of these words are "prime" i.e. which of 
these words, when converted to regular base-10 (decimal) are prime numbers. 
Hence "prime words".
